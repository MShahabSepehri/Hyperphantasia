    "seven_seg": "Solve the following puzzle. The rules are as follows.\n1. You see a grid of dots.\n2. Every dot is denoted by a red number on top right of it.\n3. Connect the following dots: \n{}\n4. What is the {}-digit number formed after connecting these dots?",
    "connect_the_dots": "In the image you see a set of dots. These dots were sampled from the outer contour of an image. Based on these dots, which of these options best describes the image?\nA: {}\nB: {}\nC: {}\nD: {}\nAnswer with the letter of the option that you think is correct.",
    "ball_trajectory": "You are given an image showing part of a ballâ€™s parabolic trajectory (in red) as it moves through the air. The ball will eventually land on a horizontal surface shown in blue. Along this surface, four positions are marked: A, B, C, and D (from right to left). Question: Based on the shape and direction of the visible trajectory, extrapolate the rest of the trajectory and determine which point (A, B, C, or D) is the first likely impact point of the ball on the surface?",
    "triangle_completion": "The image shows a triangle composed of two blue edges and one red edge. A portion of the red edge has been removed. The red line originates from the left red vertex and should connect to a point along the blue edge on the right side of the triangle. There are four possible points marked on this blue edge: A, B, C, and D. Question: Based on the direction and alignment of the red edge, extrapolate the rest of the red line and determine which point (A, B, C, or D) is the vertex of the triangle corresponding to the missing part of the red edge? Select the most geometrically consistent option."
